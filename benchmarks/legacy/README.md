# Legacy Files

This directory contains legacy files that have been moved here during the benchmark reorganization. These files are kept for reference but are no longer actively maintained.

## Moved Files

The following files have been moved from the root `benchmarks/` directory:

- Legacy benchmark scripts
- Deprecated tools
- Outdated documentation
- Experimental implementations

## Purpose

This directory serves as:
- **Historical reference**: Original implementations and approaches
- **Migration safety**: Files can be restored if needed
- **Version control**: Clean separation from current implementations

## Cleanup Schedule

Files in this directory will be reviewed quarterly and removed if:
- No longer serve as useful reference
- Contain obsolete or incorrect information
- Duplicate functionality in current implementations

## Current Status

As of the reorganization on 2025-11-17, this directory is empty. It will be populated as legacy files are identified and moved during the cleanup process.

## Contributing

When adding files to legacy:

1. Document the reason for moving the file
2. Note any dependencies or references to the file
3. Indicate if the file should be preserved long-term
4. Add appropriate metadata about the file's original purpose
